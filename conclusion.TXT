In this project, a complete data science workflow was followed:

    1. Started by clarifying the goal of our project.
    2. Collected relevant data.
    3. Cleaned the data to prepare it for analysis.
    4. Analyzed the cleaned data.

Concluded that by taking a very popular book (perhaps a more recent book) and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store market. The markets are already full of libraries, so some special features besides the raw version of the book needed to incorporated. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes on the book, a forum where people can discuss the book, etc.
